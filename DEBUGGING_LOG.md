# AlloggiFinder Frontend Issue Resolution

## Current Status
The frontend shows a white screen when accessed at localhost:5176, despite the development server appearing to run.

## Debugging Steps Completed
1. ✅ Created minimal test components (App-simple, App-minimal)
2. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and logging
3. ✅ Tested without Tailwind CSS imports
4. ✅ Created static HTML test pages
5. ✅ Added React CDN test page
6. ✅ Created debug status page

## Most Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. React 19 Compatibility Issue
**Problem**: React 19 is very new and might have compatibility issues with current tooling.
**Solution**: Downgrade to React 18 (stable)

### 2. Module Resolution Issue
**Problem**: ES modules not loading correctly
**Solution**: Check Vite configuration and ensure proper module loading

### 3. Port Conflict
**Problem**: Another service might be using port 5176
**Solution**: Try different port or kill conflicting processes

### 4. Build Process Issue
**Problem**: Vite not processing files correctly
**Solution**: Clear cache and rebuild

## Recommended Actions

1. **Downgrade React** (most likely fix):
   ```bash
   npm install react@^18.2.0 react-dom@^18.2.0
   ```

2. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   npm run build --clean
   rm -rf node_modules/.vite
   ```

3. **Test with different port**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

4. **Check for console errors** in browser developer tools

5. **Verify all dependencies are installed**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Next Steps
If React downgrade doesn't work, we'll need to:
1. Create a completely fresh Vite + React project
2. Gradually migrate components
3. Test each step to identify the breaking point
